## Purpose of the Project
  <p> This project is basically an attendance monitoring system that uses facial recognition to identify the students present in a class and then mark their attendance 
  in an excel sheet. It also recognises the facial expression of the students, which can help the teacher in analyzing the mental state of the students.
  This excel sheet can then be downloaded by the teacher in his/her mobile phone.
